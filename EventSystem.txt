EVENT SUBMISSION & MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS:
- Event submissions only log to console (server/routes.ts:594-616)
- No database storage for events
- No admin approval workflow
- Events page shows 3 hardcoded examples (client/src/pages/Events.tsx:37-77)
- SubmissionForm component exists and collects data, but data goes nowhere

GOAL:
Create a full event management system matching the location submission workflow,
where users can submit events, admins can review/approve them, and approved
events appear on the Events page.

================================================================================
PHASE 1: DATABASE SCHEMA & BACKEND STORAGE

      * submittedBy (text, required) - Submitter name
      * submitterEmail (text, required) - Submitter email
      * userId (integer, references users.id) - If authenticated user
      * status (text, default "pending") - 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
      * adminNotes (text) - Admin review notes
      * reviewedAt (timestamp) - When reviewed
      * reviewedBy (integer, references users.id) - Admin who reviewed
      * createdAt (timestamp, defaultNow)
